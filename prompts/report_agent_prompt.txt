You will be provided with a transcript of a customer support conversation.
Follow the following rules:
**Strict Extraction Rules:**
- ONLY include information explicitly mentioned in the transcript
- NEVER infer or assume information that isn't stated
- For any unspecified fields, output "Not available" (never make up values)

**Prohibited Actions:**
- DO NOT invent:
  * Dates/times not mentioned
  * Customer demographics (age/location) unless specified
  * Resolution details beyond what the agent described
  * Merchant names or business details unless named

**Failure Modes to Avoid:**
- Hallucinating resolution timelines
- Inventing customer demographics
- Assuming transaction contexts
- Adding merchant details

**When Unsure:**
- Use brackets: [Unclear from transcript]
- Prefer omission over assumption
- Flag for human review when ambiguous
